                <p>Hackly is a place where developers of all levels come to learn by doing. Whether you're self-taught, a student, or already working in tech, collaboration is one of the best ways to level up and create cool stuff.<br><br>As AI can now write code, prompt can be use to kickstart projects. Unlike codebases, they are fast to read, test, and refine, making them perfect for mass collaborative work like Wikipedia.<br><br>They are short and self-contained. You just need to read them to get all the information and start thinking about how to improve them unlike codebase.<br><br>We believe, prompt have the potential to become massively collaborative evolving documents, continually refined by a community to produce the most effective logic, just like Wikipedia articles. With this server, we want to create the perfect place to test how far we can go.</p>

                <h2>Frequently Asked Questions</h2>
                <button class="accordion">What is Hackly?</button>
                <div class="panel">
                    <p>Hackly is an online community of 400+ people working together to launch useful open source projects. Many open-source projects fail because creators have to carry everything on their own, before the project is usable, let alone attract contributors. At Hackly, we take a collaborative approach from the start—so we can make smarter decisions, share the load, and build projects that last. This challenge was born from that mindset.</p>
                </div>

                <button class="accordion">Who can join Hackly?</button>
                <div class="panel">
                    <p>Anyone interested in development can join! The main goal of this challenge is to involve a more diverse range of people in building coding projects. Since the prompt should reflect the collective input of many users, we believe that the more diverse the group, the better the outcome.</p>
                </div>

                <button class="accordion">How do projects work?</button>
                <div class="panel">
                    <p>Projects typically run for 1-2 weeks, where teams collaborate to build quick prototypes. The focus is on creating versionable solutions that can potentially evolve into practical, open-source projects. Teams work together to solve real problems while learning from each other.</p>
                </div>

                <button class="accordion">What kind of projects are built?</button>
                <div class="panel">
                    <p>Projects range from web applications to tools and utilities that solve real problems. The emphasis is on creating practical, open-source solutions that can benefit the wider community. All projects are collaborative and open to contribution.</p>
                </div>

                <button class="accordion">How do I get started?</button>
                <div class="panel">
                    <p>Simply join our Discord server using the link above! Once you're in, introduce yourself in the introductions channel and explore the different project channels. Feel free to ask questions and get involved in ongoing discussions.</p>
                </div>

                <button class="accordion" id="last_acc">Is there a cost to join?</button>
                <div class="panel">
                    <p>No, Hackly is completely free to join! We believe in making development and collaboration accessible to everyone. The only requirement is your enthusiasm to learn and contribute.</p>
